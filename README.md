# CMDMessageBox
- Opens a cmd window but it looks like a message box instead (native and fileless functionality without using powershell or mshta!).
- Window is not interactive, even when pressing CTRL-C.
- Horizontal/vertical padding, character to pad with and margin are adjustable.

# If run from live console
- replace all `%%a` and `%%b` with `%a` and `%b` respectively.
