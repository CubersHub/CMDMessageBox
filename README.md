# CMDMessageBox
- Opens a cmd window but it looks like a message box instead (native and fileless functionality without using powershell or mshta!).
- Window is not interactive, even when pressing CTRL-C.
- Horizontal/vertical padding and character to pad with are adjustable.
- Margin is always 5 spaces but it can be adjusted in the source quite easily.

# If run from live console
- replace all `%%a` and `%%b` with `%a` and `%b` respectively.
