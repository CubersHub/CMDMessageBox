# CMDMessageBox
- Display a cmd window but it looks like a message box.
- Window is not interactive, even when pressing CTRL-C.
- Horizontal and vertical padding is adjustable and the character to pad with.
- Margin is always 5 spaces but it can be adjusted in the source code quite easily.

# If run from live console
- replace all `%%a` and `%%b` with %a and %b respectively.
